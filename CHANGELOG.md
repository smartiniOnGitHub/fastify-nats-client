Summary Changelog:
- First release of my fork (see in the README for more info)

  so this has been released with this (temporary I hope) package name 'fastify-nats-client'

- Update plugin folder structure for sources, test, examples
- Add an example script for using the plugin, and publishing/subscribing messages
